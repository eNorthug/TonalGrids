# Cycles
- Periodic pattern
- Divisional hierarchy
- Reference level

# Musical dimensions
MIDI decodes music,  
- Timbral
- Metric
- Harmonic
- Dynamic
Performance dimensions - piano example
- Instrument: keyboard and pedals
- Performer: (active) hands and feet

The piano typically has 88 keys, MIDI numbers 21 to 108. Two groups of keys intermingle and differ by color and shape. Keyboard layout includes 12-key periods. For each period - as for the entire keyboard - the topology forms two layers of rectangles: white and black.

# Harmonics


Tonal grids
- Tonal levels hierarchic
- Tonal networks
- Keyboard

Metric grids
- Metric levels
- Chord elaborational hierarchy

Tonal and metric grids
- Pianoroll
- Grid containers

## Common data
Grids visualize metric and harmonic cycles, like the measure (bar), octave divisions, keyboard octave, harmonic partials, scales and chords. Contents will be interactive, animated and documented. The harmonic basis will be Disharmonics, Functional Harmony extended, and will be presented as Wiki, using grids.

TonalGrids is a scaleable project. It's kept public to attract all you people out there with an interest in music, playing, creating, visualizing ... I hope for collaboration, sharing thoughts and together making stuff that can be of use, for both developers and musicians. It's all art.
