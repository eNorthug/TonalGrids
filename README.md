# TonalGrids
Tonal and metric grids, integrated.

Tonal grids
- Tonal levels hierarchic
- Tonal networks
- Keyboard

Metric grids
- Metric levels
- Chord elaborational hierarchy

Tonal and metric grids
- Pianoroll
- Grid containers

## Common data
Grids visualize metric and harmonic cycles, as Time signature, Keyboard range, harmonic partials, scales and chords. Contents will be interactive, animated and documented. The harmonic basis will be my own: Disharmonics, Functional Harmony extended, and will be presented as Wiki, using grids.

TonalGrids is a scaleable project. It's kept public to attract all you people out there with an interest in music, playing, creating, visualizing ... I hope for collaboration, sharing thoughts and together making stuff that can be of use, for both developers and musicians. It's all art.
